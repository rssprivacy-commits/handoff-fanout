"""Per-user / per-project configuration loaded from ``$HANDOFF_HOME/config.json``.

The original ERP scripts hardcoded a number of project-specific values:
the V3.6 redlines, ``docker compose exec ... alembic current`` for baseline
detection, the path of a particular roadmap file, the VS Code URI template.
This module pulls those out so the same engine can drive any project.

All fields have sensible defaults, so an empty / missing config file is fine
and the tool works out-of-the-box for ad-hoc use.

Resolution order:
  1. ``$HANDOFF_HOME/config.json`` if it exists and parses.
  2. Built-in defaults (no inject_blocks, no baseline hooks, no roadmap).

The home directory itself is resolved from ``$HANDOFF_HOME`` (env var) or
defaults to ``~/.handoff``.
